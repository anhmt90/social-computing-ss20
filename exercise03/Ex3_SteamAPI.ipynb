    "# Exercise Sheet 3: Collaborative Filtering with Steam Games\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will build a collaborative filtering recommender system using data we gather from Steam. We will use your friends list to get information about owned games for each ID, and the time each game was played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, collaborative filtering is based on some sort of rating to determine the similarity between users. However, for games, the enjoyment and a rating do not always match. Additionally, only about 10% of players actually rate the games they play, which would make for a very incomplete dataset. Therefore, the playtime will be used instead of a rating system. This has the added benefit that playtime is usually the most authentic metric of enjoyment, as players are very unlikely to spend much time on a game they don't enjoy."

    "## Task 3.2: Association rule mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with the \"real\" recommender system, let us take a look at a more general form of recommending items using association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of association rule mining is rather simple: Looking at an itemset, one tries to find dependencies between items that could \"belong together\". A common example would be buying food at the store: If, for example, meat and salt are bought together often, but meat without salt not that often, it is assumed that there is a connection between those two. For games, if it was found that most of the users who own the demo version of a game also own the full version of that game, it would be a reasonable assumption that these users liked the demo and therefore bought the full version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first cover the mathematical basis for association rules. The most important metrics used are **support**,  **confidence** and **lift**. *Support is defined as the amount of times an item occurs in the itemset divided by the total number of items in the set*; *Confidence is defined as the support of a list of items [x,y,...] divided by the support of x*. *Lift is a measure describing the correlation between items*. Written down mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$supp(x)= \\frac{len(x)}{len(n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$conf(x=>y) = \\frac{supp(x,y)}{supp(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$lift(x=>y) = \\frac{P(x \\cap y)}{P(x) * P(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that *support refers to an item or a list of items, while confidence refers to a rule*. Also note that *a lift of 1 means that x and y occur independently of each other, while a lift greater 1 means a positive correlation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Your task here is to first convert the dictionary you created into a list of lists as this is the input required for the algorithm to work. Then, print out the most frequent items using the `min_support` attribute. Finally, print out the association rules and play around with the threshold value to get a reasonable amount of rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Discuss your results and try to answer the following questions: What kind of recommendations can be made? What does a confidence of 1.0 mean and is it meaningful for recommending games? Can you spot a correlation between the games with the highest support and the rules with the highest confidence? How does this affect the lift?  \n",
    "**Hint:** Play around with the threshold values until you get a reasonable amount (4-30) rows as output."

    "\n",
    "**Q**: *What kind of recommendations can be made?*\\\n",
    "**A**: Recommendations of popular games and recommendations of games that are frequently bought together can be made based on games owned by the target user. From a rule, one can also recommend consequent games to a user given the antecedent games currently owned by that user. However, unlike collaborative filtering, these kinds of recommendations do not require analyzing user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: *What does a confidence of $1.0$ mean and is it meaningful for recommending games?*\\\n",
    "**A**: A rule with a confidence of $1.0$ means every single user that has the antecedent game, has also bought the corresponding consequent game. This can be seen in the formula for calculating confidence: for a confidence of 1.0, it should be the case that $supp(X,Y) = supp(X)$ given that we know the target user has already ordered itemset X. This means itemset X appears together with itemset Y in every single transaction with itemset X in it. Therefore, every user that has X also owns Y. Therefore, for such rules with confidence of 1.0, if we know a user already bought games X, it is not meaningful at all to recommend games Y to him because we know for sure he also has games Y already.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: *Can you spot a correlation between the games with the highest support and the rules with the highest confidence?*\\\n",
    "**A**: When a game with the highest support is the consequent item of a rule, that rule always has a very high confidence value. The confidence for those rules is high because the antecedent itemset is such a frequent one and would be almost present in every transaction. For example, the table of association rules above shows that rules with game `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive` (highest support itemset) as their consequent item always have the highest confidence. Those are the first 6 rules in the table. Therfore, this is the pitfall of inferring rules by confidence measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: *How does this affect the lift?*\\\n",
    "**A**: Games with highest support as the consequent of a rules do not affect the lift. As we can see from the rule table \n",
    "above, lift values of the first 6 rules with consequent having the highest support are more uniformly distributed compared to the remaining rules. All lift values among all 22 rules only slightly vary inside the interval $(1.0, 1.2]$ considering the possible value range for a lift is $[0, \\infty)$, which indicates that the causal relations between the antecent and the consequent in these rules are almost independent ones. Especially for the first 6 rules in the table, they are not such strong causal relations as their respective confidence values suggest. However, all of the rules show positive correlations between the repsective antecedent and consequent, although just slightly positive. So we can say that lift is a measure more resilient itemsets with high support than confidence."

    "**Q**:*Discuss the difference in recommendations between the collaborative filtering approach and the association rule approach?*\\\n",
    "**A**: Collaborative Filtering (CF) is more user-centric than Association Rule (AR) approach. CF takes user personal preferences into account and measures the similarity between the target user and users with same preferences e.g. his/her friends, while AR derives recommendations by considering just transaction history of the whole population/user-base, and then the consequent itemset in each rule will be taken as recommendations to the target user based on the antecedent itemset/games currently owned by that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: *Would you consider one more accurate than the other? Why/why not?*\\\n",
    "**A**: CF is to some extend more accurate than AR, since it uses more data related to the target user such as personal preferences, friend list, ordered game list, playtime history, etc., while AR only uses ordered game list as antecedents to derive rules.\\\n",
    "As a rough caparison for our case, with those 12 rules from the rule table of task 3.2,  we are only able to recommend the target user (myself) game `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive` from rule `Path of Exile` $\\rightarrow$ `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive` by the AR approach although this rule is pretty weak with lift value very closed to $1.0$, indicating these two games are almost indepedent of one another. There's only one game with large uncertainty can be taken for recommendation by AR because among games owned by the target user, which are `Path of Exile`, `Europa Universalis IV`, `Titan Quest Anniversary Edition`, `Black Desert Online`, `Crusader Kings II`, only `Path of Exile` shows up in the \"antecedents\" column, even though the `min_support` threshold is set pretty low to $0.40$ and the `min_threshold` is also low to $0.40$.\n",
    "On the other hand, we can recommend the 5 games in the table above derived by CF (where game `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive` will also be recommended by CF) with high confidence that the target user will also like those games based on the large predicted playtime inferred from his friends, and therefore, increase the probability that the user will buy those games next."
